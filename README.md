IRC Bot. A lame IRC bot to be exact. Can be extended.

Update: I added a nodejs port. Why? JLT.

# What is IRC?

> Internet Relay Chat is a system that facilitates transfer of messages in the form of text

Source: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>

# Features

- Responds to 'L4M3B047 !insult {IRCnick}'
- Talks like ELIZA sometimes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA>

# WHY?

JLT. No reason. Gives me confidence that I can fiddle with Python.

# Requirements

- Python
- nodejs for node version.

# Installation

Download the files. Run 'python L4M3B047.py' or node JS version 'node JSL4M3B047.js'. You can modify insults and eliza.txt.
